Computer Science & Engineering Student 💻

Passionate about Software Engineering & Web Development
</p>

I’m a CSE student who loves building clean, creative, and meaningful software.  
I enjoy exploring web development, learning new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects.

Right now, I’m focused on building projects that mix real-world impact with modern tech — especially interactive web apps and smart tools.

One of the main projects I’m working on is:

**Quavely** — an earthquake monitoring web app with live monitoring, AI analysis, and alert systems.

###  Tech I work with

Python • HTML • CSS • Java • React • Git  

I’m always excited to keep learning, building, and improving — both as a developer and as a problem solver.
